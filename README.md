Performance analysis:
We have two classes very similar. One of them is used with "parallel" and the other has not got it.
We apply this algorithms to a large file of nucleotides to see the diference between sequential time and parallel time.
When we run the class wich has "parallel" the computing time is approximately 75, in contrast; when we run the class without "parallel" the computing time es approximately 20.
